# NVDA-Stock-Forecast
The aim of this notebook is to find the best stock listed in the S&amp;P 500 index to invest in and then predict the said stock's future price with determined models.

S&amp;P 500 Index data is from 2014-07-21 until 2024-07-19 S&amp;P 500 Stocks data is from 2010-01-04 until 2024-07-19

The stock selection is based on weight, as we go for the safest stocks to invest, meaning we go for blue-chip stocks. Based on simple profitability analysis on those stocks, we have chosen NVDA as the best stock to invest in as it has the highest gain during the analysis time frame and also the least variance, which means it has the lowest risk of all.
